# Caption Generator
## My Final Project for Harvard's CS50x Introduction to Computer Science
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/C4anVtuN54k
#### Description: This web application helps users to add captions to images ('png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif').
#### The user starts off with the Landing Page asking him to choose a file to upload.
#### Upon pressing the Upload button, the file will be saved to the Uploads folder in the directory and the user will be directed to the Generate Caption page.
#### The user can choose the font and input the words for Top Caption and Bottom Caption respectively, before pressing the Generate button.
#### Upon pressing the Generate button, a temp image will appear with the captions generated on the image with the user's chosen font.
#### The generated image can be found in the generated folder in the directory.
#### The details of the file (fileid, filename, filelocation, generatedlocation) will be saved in cs50file database in MySQL.
